# Cube Converter

## Overview

Cube Converter is an application developed for the artist Alberto Frigo. Alberto meticulously records a vast array of data from his life and surroundings, from environmental data like wind speed and cloud formations to more personal metrics. This software provides a way to transform this raw data into engaging multimedia files, primarily MP3 audio files and MP4 videos.

## Features

The Cube Converter offers a range of conversion functionalities, allowing the transformation of various data types into multimedia formats:

* **WIND to MP3:** Converts datasets representing wind intensities into an audio file (MP3). This allows for an auditory representation of wind patterns and changes over time.
* **BPM to MP3:** Transforms data representing beats per minute (BPM) into an MP3 audio file.
* **CLOUDS to MP4:** Takes series of cloud images or data representing cloud patterns and converts them into a video file (MP4). 
* **RGB to MP4:** Converts sequences of RGB color values into an MP4 video file. This can be used to visualize color data.
* **TEXT to MP4:** Transforms textual data into a scrolling text video (MP4).

## How it Works

The application provides a user-friendly interface where the artist can select the type of data they wish to convert and the specific input file(s). Based on the selected conversion type, the software processes the input data, whether it's numerical values from a PDF, image sequences, or text, and uses libraries like Pygame, Pydub, OpenCV, and PyPDF2 to generate the corresponding audio or video file. The software handles the data parsing, multimedia generation, and file formatting, outputting a ready-to-use MP3 or MP4 file.

For instance:
* Wind intensity values from a PDF can be mapped to variations in the volume or characteristics of a base wind sound, creating an MP3.
* A series of images representing clouds can be stitched together, with potential for scrolling or panning, to create an MP4 video.
* RGB values listed in a document can be translated into a sequence of colored frames, forming a color-shifting MP4.

## Connection to the Cube App

The primary purpose of the Cube Converter is to generate multimedia files that are compatible with and enhance the experience of the "Cube App." Alberto Frigo's 8x8x8 meter cube in the Alps stores a multitude of "codes" or data points. The Cube App is the key to decoding and experiencing these stored items, which can include text, video, audio, PDFs, or image files.

The files generated by Cube Converter (e.g., an MP3 of wind data, an MP4 of cloud imagery) become new, interpretable pieces of art that can be integrated into the Cube App's framework. This allows the artist and audience to dynamically showcase and explore his life's work in richer, more immersive ways.

## Purpose and Vision

The core vision behind Cube Converter is to bridge the gap between raw, often abstract, data and meaningful artistic expression. By transforming numbers, readings, and observations into sound and video, the software empowers Alberto Frigo to:

* **Add new sensory dimensions** to his extensive archive of life data.
* **Create novel interpretations** of everyday phenomena.
* **Enhance the narrative power** of his artistic projects.
* **Provide engaging content** for exploration within the "Cube App" ecosystem.
